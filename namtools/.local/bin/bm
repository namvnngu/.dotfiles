# CORE FUNCTIONS

# Adds a bookmark.
#
# If one of the options is not provided, bm enters interactive mode and prompts
# to input the category, title, and/or URL. All options must be provided. In
# both cases, once the option values are provided, bm adds a new bookmark to
# the bookmark file using the format described above.The new bookmark is
# inserted in alphabetical order (A–Z).
#
# Usage: add-bm [OPTIONS]
#
# Options:
#   -c  Bookmark category
#   -t  Bookmark title
#   -u  Bookmark URL
add-bm() {
  read -r -p "Category: " category
  read -r -p "Title: " title
  read -r -p "URL: " url

  local bookmark="${category}${bm_separator}${title}${bm_separator}${url}"
  local bookmarks=$(cat "${bm_file}")
  bookmarks="${bookmarks}\n${bookmark}"

  printf "${bookmarks}" | sort -f > "${bm_file}"
}

# Opens a bookmark in browser.
#
# If no options are provided, bm enters interactive mode, and displays all
# bookmarks from the file using the fzf view. If one of the options is
# provided, bm attempts to find the matching bookmark, and exits if none is
# found. In both cases, once a bookmark is selected or found, its URL will be
# extracted and opened in your default browser.
#
# Usage: open-bm [OPTIONS]
#
# Options:
#   -l Line number
open-bm() {
  local bm=$(fzf < "${bm_file}")
  local url=$(cut -d '|' -f 3 <<< "${bm}")
  opena "${url}"
}

# Copies a bookmark into clipboard.
#
# If no options are provided, bm enters interactive mode, and displays all
# bookmarks from the file using the fzf view. If one of the options is
# provided, bm attempts to find the matching bookmark, and exits if none is
# found. In both cases, once a bookmark is selected or found, its URL will be
# copied to clipboard.
#
# Usage: copy-bm [OPTIONS]
#
# Options:
#   -l Line number
copy-bm() {
  local bm=$(fzf < "${bm_file}")
  local url=$(cut -d '|' -f 3 <<< "${bm}")
  pbcopy <<< "${url}"
}

# Removes a bookmark.
#
# If no options are provided, bm enters interactive mode, and displays all
# bookmarks from the file using the fzf view. If one of the options is
# provided, bm attempts to find the matching bookmark, and exits if none is
# found. In both cases, once a bookmark is selected or found, its URL will be
# removed from the bookmark file.
#
# Usage: rm-bm [OPTIONS]
#
# Options:
#   -l Line number
rm-bm() {
  printf "TODO: Remove bookmark\n"
}

# Prints the content of the bookmark file.
#
# Usage: view-bm
view-bm() {
  cat "${bm_file}"
}

# Prints the usage information.

  printf "${cmd} - Manage your bookmarks
